I am currently a Senior Engineer at Huawei, 2012 Lab. Before this, I obtained my Ph.D. degree at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (POLYU) in 2022, under the kind and inspiring supervision of Prof. [Ken M. L. Yiu](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csmlyiu/) and [Zili Shao](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/zili-shao/). I was also fortunate to work closely with Dr. [Bo Tang](https://acm.sustech.edu.cn/btang/) and [Xiao Yan](https://yanxiaosunny.github.io/) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUStech).



Research Interest
======
My interests are mainly database systems and data4AI, which include query optimization, AI4DB, multi-modal query processing, and data preparation for LLMs.
